Here is a brief on what is happening with VRTC and the wigs. (v1.60)

Feb 18th, 2019: 
First Wig created using the VRTC method. Wig 1a Female comes with 2 LODs for now (more lod's as things develope).

VRTC uses a customised hair strand method where you have control over the final colours thanks to the shader that separated the RED, GREEN and BLUE channels of the texture. If you are using gimp or photoshop, click the little channels tab, ususally near the layers tab in the viewport.

Red controls variation (black is one colour, white is another, grey is a mix of both)

These are overwritten by the root and tip (Green channel and Blue channel)

The result is full control over the cololur of the hair.

A Bias and scale option has been added to the shader to boost these channel masks.

Also, the Alpha slider in unity for the Root and Tip colours control how much gets though also.

The variation colours from the Red channel, however, their alpha slider controls the gloss, which is also good to give extra variation.

I hope you enjoy this shader and the new wigs currently being made.

Later there will be a solution made so that wigs can be manipulated to fit many head types, some kind of Free-Form-Deformer (FFD). 


Many thanks,
Get in touch if you want to suggest something for this pack! :)
