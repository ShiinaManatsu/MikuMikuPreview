Thank you for buying Hair Shader 2.0
Version 1.0 - 5th October, 2018
Last Update 1.56 - 16th February, 2019

This is a heavily extended version of Hair Shader Simple with more accurate anisotopy and translucency

Please note, this shader uses alpha with dithering, similar to alpha and alpha cut-out but with some fade in the form of pattern-dithered pixels. 
Overall the effect was the best out of all the tests with Cut-out being pretty close to the next best thing. With this, at leat, you get a sense of 
transparency. If you are geting sorting issues try changing the Render Queue value at the bottom of the material inspector.

Shader Types:
Mod1				- Dither Faded Alpha (uses dots to simulate fade, best to avoid zdepth issues) (2 sided)
Mod1_FrontCulled	- Dither Faded Alpha (uses dots to simulate fade, best to avoid zdepth issues) (FrontFace Culled)
Cutout				- Harsh cutout based on alpha level and Mask clip level (2 sided)
Transparent			- Soft fade (Backface culled) Known for depth ordering issues.
Mod2				- Custom Lighting, supports better shadows
Mod3				- Refined controls and shader
VRTC				- RGBA = VRTC = Variation(Red), Root(Green), Tip(Blue), Cutout(Alpha) , this is similar to the custom HDRP Shader Graph Material.

Best Combination Mod1_FrontCulled+Transparent

Onto the shader materials:

First off you will see the Translucency settings
Strength			: the amount
Normal Distortion	: affect by normals
Scattering			: covering area
Direct				: affect that direct lights have on the effect
Ambient				: affect that ambient light has on the effect
EdgeRimLight		: how much is scattered around the edge
Shadow				: how much is killed by the shadows

BaseColor-Gloss		: The overall color of the hair(RGB) and the gloss level (A) 
					  
BaseTone_Alpha		: A texture used to create variation in tone (keep this texture quite light like the example) and the Alpha level (A)
(you can use tiling and offset with this texture) (R)Red controls metalness : (G)Green controls the tonal variations/tip color: (B) Has a Noise Effect

BaseTipColor-Power	: The color of the end tip of the hair strand(RGB) and how much of it(A)
AlphaLevel			: How much of the Alpha from the BaseTone_Alpha(A) is pushed out (contrast)
VariationFromBase	: How much of the Tonal variation of the BaseTone above is used (otherwise its white)
NormalMap			: A normal Map to use for scattering the light
BumpPower			: How much of the Normal map is pushed (0 is not at all, 1 is fully)
Metallic			: How metallic the hair is (this is also affected by the base tone texture)

Now we have the highlights..

MainHighlightColor		: The color of the main anisotropic highlight
Main Highlight Position	: The Position offset of the main Highlight
Main HighlightStrength	: The strength
Main HighlightExponent	: The width (the lower the wider)

Secondary Highlight Color	:	The color of the secondary highlight
Secondary Highlight Position:	The position offset of this highlight
Secondary Highlight Strength:	The strength
Secondary Highlight Exponent:	The width(lower value is a wider coverage)
Spread						:	How much the highlights are affected by the green channel of the normal map

And that is it for now.

This pack will be expanded on but do not worry as this shader will remain the same, new version of this shader
will have new naming and features that are only variations or alternatives to this one.

Thank you for supporting me.
